incus-ui-canonical for Debian

This incus-ui-canonical package is based on lxd-ui package by canonical.

This incus-ui-canonical package applies patches used by zabby's incus package
which bundles this static javascript based web page and modifies it to target
its use with incus instead of lxd.

The rebrading was also performed to remove reference to canonical.
