The Debian packaging of incus-ui-canonical is maintained in git, using the
merging workflow described in dgit-maint-merge(7).  There isn't a patch queue
that can be represented as a quilt series.

Currently, incus-ui-canonical is hosted at
https://github.com/osamuaoki/incus-ui-canonical.git (Once someone takes over to
make this a real Debian package, this URL should be moved to SALSA.)

Seeing the git history in the above repository should give you good
clear perspective what is in the single combined diff of this package.

If incus-ui-canonical is ever uploaded to the Debian, the following may be
used.

A detailed breakdown of the changes is available from their canonical
representation - git commits in the packaging repository.  For example,
to see the changes made by the Debian maintainer in the first upload of
upstream version 1.2.3, you could use:

    % git clone https://git.dgit.debian.org/incus-ui-canonical
    % cd foo
    % git log --oneline 1.2.3..debian/1.2.3-1 -- . ':!debian'

(If you have dgit, use `dgit clone incus-ui-canonical`, rather than plain `git clone`.)

A single combined diff, containing all the changes, follows.
